\title{Segment multiple samples simultaneously using the MultiPCF algorithm.}
\usage{
multipcf(x, gamma, w = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix of observations (samples arranged as columns)}

\item{gamma}{Penalty parameter. Higher values produce fewer segments.}

\item{w}{Optional vector of weights to apply to the data before segmenting.
Allows down-weighting of noisy samples to avoid them contributing excessively
and causing the result to be over-segmented. Must be a numeric vector the same
length as the number of columns of x.}
}
